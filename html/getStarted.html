                As Chalkboard is a free mobile app that provides students with
                free notes from professionals in the QCAA system. Students will
                use their Education of Queensland log-in's to access their
                account. Their accounts can also be manage by the admin and
                teachers at the pupil's school, making it an easy solution if a
                student lost their credentials.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Due to the students using their own accounts, the subjects that
                are accessible are restricted to their timetable. This prevents
                students from giving notes to others who shouldn't have access
                to the course's Education Plan.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                  As well as a note-taking app, Chalkboard can be used as a social media
                  in terms of communicating or finding tutors that are online or near students.
                  Students will also be able to communicate with eachother and find other users
                  through already knowing another students Education of Queensland username. This
                  is a way to prevent cyberbullying and harrassment amoungst students. Students will also be able to
                  block and report other profiles, the reports will be sent to the student in questions administration.
